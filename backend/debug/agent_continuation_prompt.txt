Original Question: Continuously scan data for duplicate data, then remove them to keep the dataset clean. @user_1_Walmart_Sales 

COMPLETION DECISION: Should we stop or continue?

Original User Question: "Continuously scan data for duplicate data, then remove them to keep the dataset clean. @user_1_Walmart_Sales "
Operations Executed So Far: 1

Previous Results:
[
  {
    "step": 1,
    "operation": "DELETE",
    "details": "Deleted 3 records",
    "success": true
  }
]

CRITICAL RULES - Apply in this exact order:

1. **EXPLICIT NUMBER REQUESTS** ("run 5 queries", "execute 10 operations"):
   - If user specified a number AND 1 < that number → Continue
   - If user specified a number AND 1 >= that number → STOP

2. **SPECIFIC DATA QUESTIONS** (User asks for ONE specific thing):
   Examples: "show total sales for each store", "display top 5 stores", "count of customers"
   
   ⚠️ CRITICAL CHECK - Does the current result ALREADY answer the user's specific question?
   - Review the user's question: "Continuously scan data for duplicate data, then remove them to keep the dataset clean. @user_1_Walmart_Sales "
   - Review the last result: Does it contain the data the user asked for?
   - If YES (question is answered) → STOP IMMEDIATELY
   - If NO (question not answered yet) → Continue
   
   DO NOT add "more insights" or "additional analysis" if the question is already answered!

3. **DATA INSERTION/MODIFICATION REQUESTS**:
   - If user asked to insert/create data and insertion was successful → STOP
   - If user asked to insert/create data but insertion failed → Continue with alternative

4. **EXPLORATORY/ANALYSIS REQUESTS** (Vague, asking for insights/patterns):
   Examples: "analyze this data", "show me patterns", "explore the dataset"
   - If 1 >= 3 → STOP (sufficient exploration)
   - If 1 < 3 → Continue with different angle

IMPORTANT: Analyze "Continuously scan data for duplicate data, then remove them to keep the dataset clean. @user_1_Walmart_Sales ":
- Is it asking for ONE specific thing that can be directly answered? (If YES and we have it → STOP)
- Or is it exploratory/vague asking for general insights? (If YES → Continue until 3 queries)

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- If STOP: Say only "OPERATION_COMPLETE"
- If CONTINUE: Brief reason (1 sentence) + "MULTI_STEP_QUERY: Step 2" + SQL query

Your decision:

=== END PROMPT ===
